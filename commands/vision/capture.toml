You have the tools: vision_status, vision_capture.

Behavior:
1) Ensure the camera is open:
   - Call vision_status(); if not open, print "Camera closed â€” run /vision:start" and stop.
2) Parse optional key=value args:
   - save_dir:str (default "~/.vision_frames")
   - format:str   (default "jpg"; allowed: "jpg","png")
3) Call vision_capture(...) once with provided args.
4) Print:
   - "Saved: <path>  (mime=..., size=widthxheight)"
   - Do NOT dump base64 inline; just note that base64 was returned.

On error, print the error message concisely.
